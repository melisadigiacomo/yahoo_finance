# Active Stocks Octuber 2021  
The aim was to analyze active stocks of most popular companies in the period from Octuber 1 to Octuber 25, 2021.  

Variables analyzed were Companies, Date, Open, High, Low, Close (close price adjusted for splits), Adj Close (Adjusted close price adjusted for splits and dividend and/or capital gain distributions), Volume. Daily Return was calculated as the natural log of daily Adj Close ratio. Currency in USD.  
 
# Stock Market Crashes  
The aim was to show stock market crashes in a 5-year period of time.  

* In December 2018, the S&P 500 fell 11 %. America's trade war with China, interest rates and uncertainty in government policy all helped to create a loss of more than 10 percent.  

* With the spread of COVID-19, global stock markets have declined significantly. US indices, including the S&P 500, have fallen close to 30%, bringing us to values previously seen in 2017.
